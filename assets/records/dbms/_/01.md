### **Aim**
> To study and implement the different types of SQL commands

### **Requirements**
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench/MySQL Command Line Client

### **Commands**
1. **Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands:**
    - `CREATE DATABASE databaseName`:  
Used to create a new table or database
    - `ALTER`:  
Used to modify an existing table structure
    - `DROP`:  
Used to delete a table or database
    - `TRUNCATE`:  
Used to remove all records from a table, but not the table itself

2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML) Commands:**
    - `INSERT`: Used to add new records to a table
    - `UPDATE`: Used to modify existing records in a table
    - `DELETE`: Used to remove records from a table
    - `SELECT`: Used to retrieve records from a table

3. **Data Control Language (DCL) Commands:**
    - `GRANT`: Used to give user access privileges to the database
    - `REVOKE`: Used to remove user access privileges from the database

4. **Transaction Control Language (TCL) Commands:**
    - `COMMIT`: Used to save all changes made during the current transaction
    - `ROLLBACK`: Used to undo changes made during the current transaction
    - `SAVEPOINT`: Used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back

### **Querys**
```sql
-- DDL Commands
CREATE DATABASE TestDB;
USE TestDB;
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Position VARCHAR(50)
);
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN Salary INT;
DROP TABLE Employees;
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;

-- DML Commands
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Position, Salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Manager', 60000);
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 65000 WHERE ID = 1;
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID = 1;
SELECT * FROM Employees;

-- DCL Commands
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TestDB.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON TestDB.* FROM 'user'@'localhost';

-- TCL Commands
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Position, Salary) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 'Developer', 55000);
SAVEPOINT SavePoint1;
ROLLBACK TO SavePoint1;
COMMIT;
```

### **Conclusion**
> This experiment provided hands-on experience with various SQL commands used in database management. Understanding these commands is essential for effective database administration and manipulation.
